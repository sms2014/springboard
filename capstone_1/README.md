# Classification of commercial bank current account clients with high propensity to subscribe to offer of term deposit
### Reason for creating:
I created this project as part of Springboard's Capstone1 project. 

### Purpose of the project:
The purpose of this project was to classify commercial bank current account customers with high propensity to subscribe to offer of term deposit. Commercial banks are interested in getting their current account customers to open term deposit accounts since term deposit accounts mean that customers will be keeping their money with the bank for a defined term (time period) which is beneficial for the bank. However, given a large number of customers with current accounts that a typical commercial bank has, it is expensive (from the perspective of marketing budget and marketing effort) to reach out to all of them. The results of this project would enable the marketing team at a commercial bank to classify only those current account customers with high propensity to subscribe to offer of term deposit and hence reach out only to them, enabling the marketing team to optimize on their marketing budget/effort.
