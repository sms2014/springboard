# Recommendation of products to online grocer customers based on similarity of their orders
### Reason for creating:
I created this project as part of Springboard's Capstone2 project. 

### Purpose of project:
The purpose of this project was to recommend relevant products to online grocer customers based on similarity of their orders. Online grocers are interested in making sure that their customers continue to stay engaged with their technology platform. One of the ways they can do this is by recommending relevant products to their customers based on their purchasing history (content based filtering approach) or their similarity to other customers (collaborative filtering approach). The results of this project would be useful to marketing team at an online grocer in recommending relevant products to their customers based on collaborative filtering approach.
